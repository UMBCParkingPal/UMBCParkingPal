		<h4>Section 1: Registering/Logging In</h4><br>
		
		<h5 id="1-2"><b>1.1 How do I register or log in?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">When you first go on to our site, you will be taken to a splash page
		with our Terms of Service. To either register or sign in, click on the button in the top right of the page.
		If this is your first time logging into our site, it will automatically take you to 
		a registration page to confirm your e-mail address and fill out any additional information needed
		to use our site. If you have already logged in before, you will be redirected to your personal
		home page upon log in.
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="1-3"><b>1.2 Can I use a non-UMBC e-mail to register?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">At this time, this webapp is solely for the use of UMBC student and
		faculty. Because we cannot check whether an alternate e-mail address belongs to someone
		affiliated with UMBC, we have decided against giving people the option to use a different
		e-mail.
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="2-1"><b>1.3 I can't sign in to the webapp.</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">Please make sure that you're using your UMBC e-mail to login. If
		you continue to have problems, please e-mail naomis1@umbc.edu for support.

		<h4>Section 2: Selling</h4><br>
		
		<h5 id="2-2"><b>2.1 How do I put up a listing?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">To put up an ad, click on the 'Sell' button on the navigation bar
		at the top. On the selling page, you will be required to enter all fields to continue. 
		Please note that you will be unable to put up a listing if you already have an active listing
		up on the site.
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="2-3"><b>2.2 What is the range of prices I can ask for on my listing?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">You will be able to input a whole dollar value between $1 and $5. It is
		capped at $5 to prevent abuse of the system. 
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="2-4"><b>2.3 I no longer wish to sell my parking spot. How can I cancel my listing?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">If you navigate back to your personal home page, you should see
		your current listing. If you click on the 'x' in the corner of your listing, you will be able
		to cancel your listing. There is no time limit to when you can cancel your ad and you
		will not face any negative consequences for cancelling your listing early.
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="2-5"><b>2.4 What happens if my spot isn't sold?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">Your listing will automatically be taken down once it has passed the

		you are free to leave your spot. 
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="2-6"><b>2.5 What happens if I leave my spot before any transaction has taken place?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">If you cancelled your listing already, you are good to go. If you kept your
		listing up and someone ends up buying that spot, you are obligated to give that spot to that user,
		whether you are currently in the position to or not. If for some reason the sold spot is
		no longer available to the buyer, 
		</div><br>
		
		<h5 id="3-1"><b>2.6 My spot was bought by a user, but they still haven't shown up. What should I do?</b><br></h5>
		<div class="tabbed">If the user does not show up within 10 minutes of the departure time, it is considered
		a no-show. You will be able to keep the money that they paid for that spot and are no longer
		obligated to wait for the buyer to show up to complete the transaction.
		</div><br>
